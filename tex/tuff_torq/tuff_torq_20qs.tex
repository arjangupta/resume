\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Question 1:} Can you tell me about your relevant experience for this position?
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Answer:} Absolutely. First off, I have a Bachelor's degree in 
        Computer Engineering from the University of Kansas, and 
        6+ years of experience as a software engineer. I am also
        working towards a Master's degree in Robotics Engineering
        from Worcester Polytechnic Institute, with a specialization
        in autonomous vehicles.\\

        My current position involves building a semi-autonomous motion system
        for an enormous agricultural machine called an irrigation pivot.
        I improve the system's ability to navigate the field including
        path planning, GPS dead-reckoning, and obstacle detection using
        on-board sensors. I mainly
        do this by writing C/C++ code for a complex embedded system on the machine.
        I write test scripts for the system in Python.\\

        Furthermore, in my Robotics Master's degree program, am working with
        a variety of robotics frameworks
        and libraries including ROS2, Gazebo, and TensorFlow. I am developing
        machine learning, deep learning, and reinforcement learning
        for both academic and personal projects. Here, I use Python extensively.\\

        I am also a Co-founder of a very early-stage company where I use
        PyTorch, OpenCV, and YOLOv7 to help daycare workers keep track of
        children that might have been left unattended. In this position,
        I write Python and JavaScript.\\

        Other notable and related experience includes my work with biometric
        facial recognition systems, which relied on a pipeline of computer
        vision and machine learning algorithms. Also, at a previous company,
        I have contributed to the 3 degree of freedom (DOF) motion planning
        of a robotic arm that used a LiDAR sensor to estimate the volume
        of grain in a silo.\\
    \end{itemize}
    
    \item \textbf{Question 2:} What Specific Skills do you posses that make you a strong candidate for this role?
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Answer:} I have a strong background in software engineering
        and robotics. I am able to write C, C++, and Python code proficiently
        to develop software for various applications.\\

        I am comfortable with designing and implementing 
        machine learning models, 
        neural networks,
        and reinforcement learning algorithms. I can solve vision
        and path planning problems using OpenCV and ROS2. Because of
        my Master's program, I am familiar with SLAM (Simultaneous
        Localization and Mapping) techniques. Because of my experience 
        in embedded systems, I have
        a strong understanding of sensors and sensor fusion.\\

        I am well-versed in using Git for version control, writing
        requirements and design documents, and writing unit tests for my code.
        I also mentor junior engineers and interns, and I am comfortable
        communicating with both technical and non-technical stakeholders.
    \end{itemize}
    
    \item \textbf{Question 3:} How do you approach problem solving or handling challenges in the workplace?
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Answer:} I approach problem solving by first
        understanding the problem and its context. For example, if I am tasked
        with debugging a GPS dead-reckoning algorithm, I would first
        understand how the algorithm is being used on the system as a whole.
        I would collect information about the problem by asking what the
        unexpected and expected behaviors are. Then, I would formulate a hypothesis about the problem and
        test it. If the hypothesis is incorrect, I use what I've learned
        in testing the system so far to formulate a new hypothesis, and
        then repeat the process.\\

        However, sometimes the problem is not well understood, and the
        challenge is to understand the problem itself. In this case,
        I would use a similar approach, but I would also do research
        to understand the problem better. Sometimes this can involve
        studying a technology or sub-field of engineering that I am
        not familiar with. However, when I am comfortable with a certain
        level of understanding, I re-assess the problem and formulate
        a hypothesis on where to look next.
    \end{itemize}
    
    \item \textbf{Question 4:} Can you provide an example of a project or accomplishment you are proud of?
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Answer:} I am proud of my work on the irrigation pivot project
        where I built a semi-autonomous motion system for an enormous agricultural
        machine. I collaborated with other engineers to build many parts of this
        system. I wrote drivers for sensors and the network stack, so that 
        information about the system could be communicated to the control
        system. I heavily improved the motion planning algorithm, which
        involved writing a path planner that can intelligently decide
        when to energize the
        motors to move the machine. This takes into account checking
        relays, checking the state of the machine, and checking the
        state of the motors. A mapping of the field is also used to
        determine the best path to take.
        Furthermore, I also wrote a GPS dead-reckoning algorithm
        that can estimate the position of the machine when GPS is not available.
    \end{itemize}
    
    \item \textbf{Question 5:} How do you stay updated and continually improve your knowledge and skills in your field?
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Answer:} I have several ways of keeping my knowledge current. First of all,
        I am currently pursuing a Master's degree in Robotics Engineering, so taking new courses
        is one way I continually improve my knowledge and skills. However, my 
        desire to learn new things extends beyond the degree. I have
        taken Coursera courses on machine learning and deep learning, and I
        have also taken Udemy courses on YOLOv7 and YOLOv8. I also read
        research papers on a variety of topics, including reinforcement learning,
        robot dynamics, and computer vision. My sister is also a PhD student
        in Neuroscience, so I often discuss research papers with her, even
        if they are not directly related to my field.\\
    \end{itemize}
    
    \item \textbf{Question 6:} Describe a situation where you had to work collaboratively as part of a team to achieve a goal.
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Answer:} I have a few examples of working collaboratively as part of a team, but I 
        will use the instance where I worked with a team of engineers to build a 3 degree of
        freedom (DOF) robotic arm that uses a LiDAR sensor to estimate the volume of grain in a silo.\\

        I was responsible for
        relaying the point cloud data from the LiDAR sensor
        so that it can be transmitted to the cloud via the cellular network on-board.
        I collaborated with a senior firmware engineer to
        retrieve information from the CAN bus interface for the LiDAR sensor.
        I also helped with the motion planning of the robotic arm where it
        needed to perform a sweep of the silo to estimate the volume of grain. Here,
        the simulation was done with a senior mechanical engineer, so we
        used the path planned by the simulation to implement the motion
        planning algorithm. This involved PWM control of the motors, as well
        as sensing the angles of the motors. We also collaborated with an
        electrical engineer to bring up the PCB for the robotic arm, and
        tested the PCB with the motors and sensors.\\
    \end{itemize}
    
    \item \textbf{Question 7:} How do you prioritize your work and manage your time effectively?
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Answer:} For me, the best way to do this is by breaking down
        the task at hand into smaller tasks. I then prioritize these tasks
        in a project management tool like Jira. I also use a Kanban board
        to visualize the tasks that I am working on. For each task,
        I estimate the time it will take to complete it, and I thereby also
        estimate the time it will take to complete the entire project. I also
        plan in time for unexpected tasks that might come up. Once I have
        planned, I schedule focus-time on my calendar to work on the tasks.
    \end{itemize}
    
    \item \textbf{Question 8:} Can you share an experience where you demonstrated leadership skills or took initiative?
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Answer:} At my current position, we have recently hired
        a new engineer. The week that he started working with us, my team-lead was swamped
        with work, and this was causing the new-hire to sit idle for his first
        couple of days. The new-hire needed someone to help him get up
        to speed and guide him through some tasks.
        At this point, I took the initiative to mentor the new engineer.
        I had a set of tasks that I was working on, and I delegated some
        of these tasks to the new engineer. I also helped him get set up
        with the tools and software that we use. When I took on this initiative,
        I replaced the time I had allocated for the tasks I delegated
        with time for mentoring the new engineer, so that I could
        help him in an organized and effective manner.
        I also made sure to check in with him
        regularly to see if he needed any help. When he did need help,
        I would pair-program with him to help him get unstuck. I showed him
        many debugging techniques, and I also showed him how to perform
        professional code reviews. This made his first few weeks at our
        company very productive, and as a result, my team lead was
        impressed with both of our work. This way, not only did I finish my tasks
        in the time I had already allocated, but I also brought up a new
        engineer to speed, while creating a rapport with him.
    \end{itemize}
    
    \item \textbf{Question 9:} How do you handle feedback and criticism from others?
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Answer:} The way I handle feedback and criticism from others
        is by seeking it deliberately and regularly. This way, I mentally prepare
        myself to receive the feedback, and even something harsh is not
        unexpected. To do this, I also attempt to keep the
        demeanor positive by simply asking, ``How can I improve?'' after
        working with someone on a project.

        In general, I am always looking for ways to improve,
        so I attempt to keep an open mind when receiving feedback. When
        someone provides me with suggestions on how to improve, I take
        their perspective with empathy, and I try to understand why they
        are suggesting the change. I also try to understand the context
        of the feedback, and I try to understand the problem that the
        feedback is trying to solve. I then take the feedback and
        incorporate it into my work.
    \end{itemize}
    
    \item \textbf{Question 10:} What interests you about this position and our organization?
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Answer:} It has been my dream to work in the field of autonomous
        machines, and I am very excited about the prospect of working at Tuff Torq.
        In particular, I am interested in the work that Tuff Torq is doing
        with off-road autonomous systems. I think this is a unique and
        exciting opportunity to build something that will have a positive
        impact on the world (usually, autonomous vehicles automatically means
        cars, but in this case, it is off-road and unique).
        I am also interested in the fact that Tuff Torq
        is a well-established company with a long history of innovation
        and excellence. I am excited to be a part of this tradition, and
        I look forward to contributing to the company's success.
    \end{itemize}
    
    \item \textbf{Question 11:} How do you adapt to change and handle ambiguity?
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Answer:} Change is the only constant in life, and I have
        plenty of experience adapting to change. Let me provide a concrete
        example. All the companies I have
        worked for have been usually acquired by larger companies, and
        this has often resulted in a change in the company culture. Sometimes,
        there has been ambiguity in the work that needs to be done as well.
        However, I have found that keeping a positive attitude is key in
        these situations. Wearing a smile and having a good sense of humor
        can uplift the morale of the team.
        I have also found that being flexible and 
        accommodating to the new situation is important. For example, if
        a new process is introduced, I try to understand the reason for
        the process, and I try to follow it to the best of my ability.\\
        
        When there is doubt
        in what needs to be done, I have found that taking initiative
        helping the company in any way I can is a good way to get started.
        For example, if there is ambiguity on how we need to organize
        the timeline of a project, it is best to take an initiative and
        schedule a meeting to discuss the timeline (as long as it is fine
        with my manager).
    \end{itemize}
