\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Question 1:} Can you tell me about your relevant experience for this position?
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Answer:} Absolutely. First off, I have a Bachelor's degree in 
        Computer Engineering from the University of Kansas, and 
        6+ years of experience as a software engineer. I am also
        working towards a Master's degree in Robotics Engineering
        from Worcester Polytechnic Institute, with a specialization
        in autonomous vehicles.\\

        My current position involves building a semi-autonomous motion system
        for an enormous agricultural machine called an irrigation pivot.
        I improve the system's ability to navigate the field including
        path planning, GPS dead-reckoning, and obstacle detection using
        on-board sensors. I mainly
        do this by writing C/C++ code for a complex embedded system on the machine.
        I write test scripts for the system in Python.\\

        Furthermore, in my Robotics Master's degree program, am working with
        a variety of robotics frameworks
        and libraries including ROS2, Gazebo, and TensorFlow. I am developing
        machine learning, deep learning, and reinforcement learning
        for both academic and personal projects. Here, I use Python extensively.\\

        I am also a Co-founder of a very early-stage company where I use
        PyTorch, OpenCV, and YOLOv7 to help daycare workers keep track of
        children that might have been left unattended. In this position,
        I write Python and JavaScript.\\

        Other notable and related experience includes my work with biometric
        facial recognition systems, which relied on a pipeline of computer
        vision and machine learning algorithms. Also, at a previous company,
        I have contributed to the 3 degree of freedom (DOF) motion planning
        of a robotic arm that used a LiDAR sensor to estimate the volume
        of grain in a silo.\\
    \end{itemize}
    
    \item \textbf{Question 2:} What Specific Skills do you posses that make you a strong candidate for this role?
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Answer:} I have a strong background in software engineering
        and robotics. I am able to write C, C++, and Python code proficiently
        to develop software for various applications.\\

        I am comfortable with designing and implementing 
        machine learning models, 
        neural networks,
        and reinforcement learning algorithms. I can solve vision
        and path planning problems using OpenCV and ROS2. Because of
        my Master's program, I am familiar with SLAM (Simultaneous
        Localization and Mapping) techniques. Because of my experience 
        in embedded systems, I have
        a strong understanding of sensors and sensor fusion.\\

        I am well-versed in using Git for version control, writing
        requirements and design documents, and writing unit tests for my code.
        I also mentor junior engineers and interns, and I am comfortable
        communicating with both technical and non-technical stakeholders.
    \end{itemize}
    
    \item \textbf{Question 3:} How do you approach problem solving or handling challenges in the workplace?
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Answer:} I approach problem solving by first
        understanding the problem and its context. For example, if I am tasked
        with debugging a GPS dead-reckoning algorithm, I would first
        understand how the algorithm is being used on the system as a whole.
        I would collect information about the problem by asking what the
        unexpected and expected behaviors are. Then, I would formulate a hypothesis about the problem and
        test it. If the hypothesis is incorrect, I use what I've learned
        in testing the system so far to formulate a new hypothesis, and
        then repeat the process.\\

        However, sometimes the problem is not well understood, and the
        challenge is to understand the problem itself. In this case,
        I would use a similar approach, but I would also do research
        to understand the problem better. Sometimes this can involve
        studying a technology or sub-field of engineering that I am
        not familiar with. However, when I am comfortable with a certain
        level of understanding, I re-assess the problem and formulate
        a hypothesis on where to look next.
    \end{itemize}
    
    \item \textbf{Question 4:} Can you provide an example of a project or accomplishment you are proud of?
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Answer:} I am proud of my work on the irrigation pivot project
        where I built a semi-autonomous motion system for an enormous agricultural
        machine. I collaborated with other engineers to build many parts of this
        system. I wrote drivers for sensors and the network stack, so that 
        information about the system could be communicated to the control
        system. I heavily improved the motion planning algorithm, which
        involved writing a path planner that can intelligently decide
        when to energize the
        motors to move the machine. This takes into account checking
        relays, checking the state of the machine, and checking the
        state of the motors. A mapping of the field is also used to
        determine the best path to take.
        Furthermore, I also wrote a GPS dead-reckoning algorithm
        that can estimate the position of the machine when GPS is not available.
    \end{itemize}
    
    \item \textbf{Question 5:} How do you stay updated and continually improve your knowledge and skills in your field?
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Answer:} I have several ways of keeping my knowledge current. First of all,
        I am currently pursuing a Master's degree in Robotics Engineering, so taking new courses
        is one way I continually improve my knowledge and skills. However, my 
        desire to learn new things extends beyond the degree. I have
        taken Coursera courses on machine learning and deep learning, and I
        have also taken Udemy courses on YOLOv7 and YOLOv8. I also read
        research papers on a variety of topics, including reinforcement learning,
        robot dynamics, and computer vision. My sister is also a PhD student
        in Neuroscience, so I often discuss research papers with her, even
        if they are not directly related to my field.\\
